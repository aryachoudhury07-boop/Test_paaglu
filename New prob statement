Title:

Life Sciences Research Paper Summarization & Hypothesis Gonorator

Problem Staternent:

Researchers in life sciences face an overwhelming volume of new publications daily, making it difficult to stay current and formulate novel hypotheses. Manual literature reviews are time-intensive and may miss relevant connections. A generative Al agent that summarizes recent papers, extracts key findings, and proposes hypotheses by integrating multiple sources can accelerate research workflows.

Data Requirements:

Access to PubMed API for paper abstracts and metadata, sample full-text papers (open access), user authentication data.

(Feel free to generate synthetic data as well from the provided access)

Expected Output:

TATI

A web application featuring multi-agent LLM summarization and hypothesis generation, clean UX for topic input and result exploration, multiple API integrations, user management, documentation detailing data sources and architecture, test cases for summarization accuracy and Ul components, and metrics on summarization quality and hypothesis novelty.
